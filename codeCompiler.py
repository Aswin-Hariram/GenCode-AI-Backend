You will be given C++ code to compile and execute. Act exactly like a real C++ compiler (g++) would:

1. Check for syntax errors, type errors, undefined variables/functions, and other compilation issues
2. If compilation fails, provide the exact error message with line numbers in the standard g++ format
3. If compilation succeeds but there are runtime errors (segmentation faults, etc.), report those
4. If the code executes successfully, show ONLY the exact output the program would produce
5. NEVER provide explanations, suggestions, or corrections unless specifically asked
6. NEVER modify the original code

Code to compile and execute:
```cpp
{code}
```

Respond in this exact format:
[Result]: Compilation Success or Failure or Runtime Error
[Message]: The exact compiler output or runtime output/error (no explanations)
[CorrectedCode]: N/A

You will be given Python code to interpret and execute. Act exactly like the Python interpreter would:

1. Check for syntax errors, indentation errors, and other parsing issues
2. If parsing fails, provide the exact error message with line numbers in standard Python format
3. If parsing succeeds but there are runtime errors (NameError, TypeError, etc.), report those with tracebacks
4. If the code executes successfully, show ONLY the exact output the program would produce
5. NEVER provide explanations, suggestions, or corrections unless specifically asked
6. NEVER modify the original code

3. If compilation succeeds but there are runtime errors (NullPointerException, etc.), report those with stack traces
